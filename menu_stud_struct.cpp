ðŸ“Œ Explanation
Student Structure

Stores rollNo and name for students.
Student Management

AcceptStudents() â†’ Reads student records.
DisplayStudents() â†’ Displays student records.
SortStudents() â†’ Sorts students by rollNo (Bubble Sort).
Other Functionalities

AcceptAndDisplayString() â†’ Accepts n characters and prints as a string.
FindAverage() â†’ Computes the average of n numbers.
MultiplyByTwo() â†’ Multiplies n numbers by 2 and displays them.
Menu-Driven Program

Uses a do-while loop for repeated execution until the user exits.
